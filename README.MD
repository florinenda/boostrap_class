## Using Bootstrap for the first time ðŸŽ‰
### Hello, today's theme of my Bootcamp course was Bootstrap and I've enjoyed the process.
### I've added some customization to make the final visual more appealing so my project can appear like a fictional home page of a travel app.
### My project contains:
- The images paste
- The bootstrap paste composed of JS & CSS frameworks
- The styling file (CSS)
- The html file
